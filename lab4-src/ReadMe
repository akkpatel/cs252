Part1:
  Question 3: It keeps printing character "A", "B" and "C" in random order.

  Question 5: It keeps printing character "C" in an infinite loop, because before the threads are called its already
		gone to another function in thr.cc where it is in infinite loop without any exit, this is the reason it keeps printing "C".


Part3:
  Question 4: 
			Kernel		User		Real
	Pthread:	0m1.068s	0m1.672s	0m1.378s
Spinlock(without thr): 0m0.004s	0m2.588s	0m1.302s
Spinlock(with thr):	0m0.348s	0m0.696s      0m0.527s


1. kernel time with thread is slower then the one without. But the user time is faster with thread in spinlocks.

1. The programs spends a lot of time in user mode, without thread but takes faster time in kernel and rel.
Count_spin with thread is lot faster in kernel though.
